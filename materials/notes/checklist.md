-[ ] Implement a simple proof-of-concept circuit. Try to split into sub-circuits and compare the empirical results.
-[ ] Inspect the structure of different circuits and try to understand what makes them a good candidate for parallelisation.
-[ ] Try to think about the rules that tell you what is the most parallelized circuit.
